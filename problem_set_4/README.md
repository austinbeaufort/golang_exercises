This problem set comes from:
https://pynative.com/

This problem set includes any remaining exercises from the PyNative site that looked interesting.
Some were repeats so I have hand selected the exercises that I think would give me the most value.

Note I have also included error.go and inputs.go files as a helper functions to incoprorate DRY principles.

How to use:

1. Uncomment the solution you'd like to see in app.go
2. Use go build to create a binary file. (make sure to include the app.go, error.go, and inputs.go files in your build along
   with the .go exercise file you are building). (Example: go build 1_of_10.go app.go error.go inputs.go)
3. Use the created binary file to run the exercise.

Instructions for each problem are at the top of each file.
