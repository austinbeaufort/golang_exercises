This problem set comes from:
https://pynative.com/python-input-and-output-exercise/

This problem set includes 10 exercises.

Note I have also included errors.go and inputs.go files as helper functions to incoprorate DRY principles.

How to use:

1. Uncomment the solution you'd like to see in app.go
2. Use "go build \*.go" and then run the created binary file to run the exercise.

Instructions for each problem are at the top of each file.
